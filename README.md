## **About Percy**

**Percy** is an innovative disaster-resilience solution designed to empower everyday vehicles with amphibious capabilities during floods. Named after the demigod which connected land and water, Percy symbolizes mobility across both terrains. It is a **modular, attachable kit** that transforms a standard car into a floatable, flood-ready vehicle‚Äîenhancing personal safety and reducing reliance on overwhelmed emergency services.

Percy is developed with the aim of creating a **scalable, accessible, and cost-effective solution** to combat the growing threat of urban and rural flooding in India.

## **The Problem**

Floods remain one of the most destructive natural disasters, with worsening frequency and impact due to climate change:

* **Over 20 million** people are affected by floods each year in India.
* **Infrastructure damage**, displacement, and fatalities are common outcomes.
* **Emergency response systems** are often delayed, limited, or inaccessible in remote or heavily affected areas.
* There is a **lack of affordable, adaptable solutions** for personal vehicles to remain mobile during floods.

## **Our Solution ‚Äì Percy**

Percy is a **detachable, amphibious kit** that can be fitted to existing vehicles in flood-prone areas. It includes:

* **Depth Sensors** to detect rising water levels
* **Inflatable Buoyant Tubes** for vehicle flotation
* **Mini Air Pumps** for rapid inflation
* **Paddle-Style Spokes** on wheels for basic water propulsion
* **Manual & Automatic Deployment** for redundancy and ease-of-use

When water crosses a set depth threshold, Percy‚Äôs **‚ÄúRiptide Mode‚Äù** activates automatically, inflating the floatation system and transforming the vehicle into a buoyant structure and with the help of paddle-style spokes in the wheels, capable of navigating shallow floodwaters.

## **Advantages**

* ‚úÖ **Reliable in Emergencies**
* üöó **Compatible with Existing Vehicles**
* üí∏ **Affordable and Scalable**
* üõü **Reduces Dependence on Emergency Services**
* üåä **Enables Amphibious Mobility**
* üß† **Simple to Deploy ‚Äì Manual and Automatic Modes**

## **Future Developments**

* **Integrated Anchor System (IAS):** To fix and stabilize vehicles in high-current flood conditions.
* **GPS Module with SOS Button:** Allows users to transmit real-time location to rescue teams or emergency contacts.
* **Load Averaging System:** Using a microcontroller to process data from multiple depth sensors for more accurate deployment.
* **Refractive Spoke Design:** Refractive paddle-spoke designs for the wheels.

## **Competitions & Recognition**

Percy was showcased at two prestigious innovation competitions:

* üõ† **DesignTrek, National Institute of Design** ‚Äì Where we presented the concept and received expert feedback on modular scalability and deployment.
* üí° **Kriti, Kothari International School** ‚Äì Where our project was appreciated for its affordability and real-world impact in disaster-prone zones.

These events helped us gather critical feedback that directly influenced the evolution of Percy‚Äôs design and deployment strategy.

## **Feedback and Improvements**

One key insight we received was to avoid integrating Percy into vehicle assembly lines, as flood risk varies regionally. Instead, we redesigned it as a **modular kit attachable to existing vehicles**, making it accessible specifically in **flood-prone regions** where it's most needed.
